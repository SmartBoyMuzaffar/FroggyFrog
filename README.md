## How Attackers Are Using Telegram to Control Malware

- As early as 2017, attackers have been using Telegram to control malicious software from a distance. One notable example of this is the Masad Stealer program that emptied victims’ crypto wallets that year.
- Check Point researcher Omer Hofman says that the company has found 130 ToxicEye attacks using this method from February to April of 2021, and there are a few things that make Telegram useful to bad actors who spread malware.
- For one thing, Telegram isn’t blocked by firewall software. It also isn’t blocked by network management tools. It’s an easy-to-use app that many people recognize as legitimate, and thus, let their guard down around.
- Registering for Telegram only requires a mobile number, so attackers can remain anonymous. It also lets them attack devices from their mobile device, meaning that they can launch a cyberattack from just about anywhere. Anonymity makes attributing the attacks to someone—and stopping them—extremely difficult.
